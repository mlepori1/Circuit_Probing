### Examples Folder
For cases where we need to *train* a model before alignment, we provide some examples coming off from models we trained to solve some reasoning puzzles. Normally, the tasks we are looking at are reasoning tasks that involve multi-step reasonings. In the alignment process, we will then try to see if the model (i.e., the neural network) is solving a task like a human task taker.

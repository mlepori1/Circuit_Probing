It was telephone conference , and it was only me and , you know , the guy . no ,
no , I am lucky to that because my father gets sick and in hospital now , so she
had to quit . I want to meet on one or two o'clock in afternoon . So she just
kept asking , " Please , please , please can I have her ? So , recently , Gusto
or Jonathan 's , such a restaurant have free drink corner . are you — now ?
there are one cat on the car . " Good Will Hunting " . And there are various
clothes . Upright , I think . Thank you . And some alcohol will help us a lot .
I want to dress . And then you always have to drive your car to go somewhere .
excuse me , what is your shop ? so when I order , I always have to ask what 's
inside of this . because , last night , I drank a lot . But I do n't think it 's
very safe if nobody knows much about the place or the landscape , because you
never know what would happen as in the picture . I will go to Shibuya in dinner
. I will be working for the newspaper again . But there must be nice ones at
Hiroshima . To buy some books . In a fine day , a girl and a boy go to a zoo .
It 's a also sales corner . I wonder . I 'm a customer ? the main point is that
it 's not just we the students move to the other class . I 'm sorry . But then I
eat a little bit of fish and the fish broth is always in Japanese food . I see .
I want to study about Human Literature next year . OK , there 's roughly forty
students in the club . I like dolphin is animal . two years ago , I wanted to
find out a new house because at that time , I lived in my parents ' house . I
will go to Shinjuku , and I play with my friend . Then , I want to use that tour
, but how it costs ? But depends on what kind of party . My name is Charlie .
more darkness . I mean they always welcome to and I bought him a clothes for
congratulation . It 's a very big city . I see . So that website is created by
women for women . Not really , not that much . So it 's good to live , I think .
Are you sure ? Because I had the receipt . I 'd like to go to travel by airplane
or ship or by car . And also we had a kind of school uniform . Why I think so
because I have been in Australia for three years . Yes , I do . And they ended
up staying in a hotel room and looking out outside from the room . About
anything in this picture ? Then , it was very beautiful place where they can see
mountains . But eventually , the boy and the girl brought the cat . Not so many
Japanese there . but their house was not so big . But still the differences say
, how should I describe it , in terms of the not only appearance but the way
they behave . Interesting in Turkey ? more nante iundaro whipped it or . I 'm
feeling like I 'm a student . And in the far end of the restaurant , a lady is
playing the piano . and they went to the zoo . I belong to Noh club . My room is
books and videos and somethings , my room i my room is very dirty . So I 'm very
in hurry . And this man came on a bike with a mobile phone on his hand . But ,
sometimes I want buy clothes , suddenly . I 'm in the house . My name is Charlie
. And " Star Wars " joei . It has a lot of supermarkets and schools and cultural
facilities like library and concert hall . Yes thank you . They looked at lion .
You are welcome . when I went to Okinawa in December with my friend , we went a
nice restaurant . but when I reached to Singapore , there 's nobody who received
me at the airport . My name is Charlie . She tried to attract the students more
. I 'm truly sorry again . And unfortunately , the man on the motorcycle bumped
in to the car . I do n't know . So we do n't have dogs . Maybe she 's gon na be
better than my English .... it looks just alike . there are , for example ,
boiled fish or curry rice , such a very ordinary foods . But I do n't know why
So rather than skiing , I prefer skating because skating , you do n't have to go
up , and you 're just going round and round on this flat surface . in the movie
theater because in the movie theater , yes , it is very big scene . and then his
father had to go somewhere with my girlfriend . And also , they have a very
different atmosphere than other restaurants . thank you . And then he just had
to have his motorcycle towed away because it was not fit to driving . It is nine
o'clock . He dropped his cellular phone . And it looks like it does n't fit me .
Yes , yes . She 's kind of like a waitress . So I do n't remember the scenery .

alone , and the window is broken and have to work tomorrow . You know , we hang
out . You , too . I 'm from Saitama - ku . it 's not fair because I 'm a
passenger . So they get along very well . You know ? the place is right next
door . Thank you . I 'm working very harder in my office . I have to apologize
first that I could n't come to the party you invited me for . So that 's the bad
point I think . thank you . that 's why many people , I think they drive over
speed anyway . a small girl is playing in front of the big window who seems to
be a daughter of this family . Nice to meet you . And my father and booked a
restaurant we sat on the table . Only been about seven months or so . So I could

same college , and she 's actress . Things are very deferent in my neighborhood
and the rest of downtown area . And I was born in Tokyo prefecture and always it
snows one meter or more . And not only the photographer , also his story about ,
the photograph in the mountain was quite impressed me . I have a one sister ,
and my parents . Just call me Charlie like a tuna . And he happen to come to
Japan . And also the attitude of the students is quite different . And I also
try to see a lot of movies and I try to see a lot of shows on T V to keep me up
- to - date about what 's going on inside those young kids minds . It 's summer
holiday there . it is featuring , I do n't know his name , but small boy and
directed by Steven Spielberg . So , see if I was talking to American people , it

this I have school . maybe it 's not a car . And they promised to meet in the
front of restaurant . It 's OK , yes . Yes , I 'm fine , thank you . so and my

points in her life , she has to make a decision . the door is open . So until
this coming this station , so today heavy traffic jam Thank you very much . I
likes play sport . fine , thank you . Yamanoko has very many people and boys are
more than girls . Because to tell the truth , I will reply for the programs of

restaurant or like renting out a place would take money or take time as in
planning . But now she look at her pet . And Taro explained the situation to the
police officer . curry , ramen . I like it . So but this is a big store . and
then if you are on , you have to call your insurance company . But not Alpine
ski . So I want to go to New York are as soon as possible . I did n't do
anything . But before it , I go to Starbucks , because I like coffee . And you
